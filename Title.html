    <h1>Environment and Vehicles</h1>
    <h2>This interactive visualization aims to present a comprehensive analysis about the influence of air pollution and greenhouse gas from various factors of vehicles. At the end of this exploration, the user can gain more insights about the definition of what environmental friendly vehicle is. From various parameters of the vehicle, I have calculated the average of two types of score:</h2>
    <p>Air polluion score(0~10): reflects vehicle tailpipe emissions that contribute to local and regional air pollution</p>
    <p>Greenhouse gas score(0~10): reflects measurement in the impact of on greenhouse gas emissions from a vehicle</p>
    <p>If the higher the vehicle scores, the less the vehicle contributes to global warming and climate change. We will also examine the rate of CO2 combustion(g/km) for reference</p>

   
    <h3>Scene 1: Engine Displacement</h3>
    <p>Engine displacement is determined by calculating the engine cylinder bore area multiplied by the stroke of the crankshaft, and then multiplied by the number of cylinders</p>

    
    <h4>Scene 2: Transmission Type</h4>
    <p>Transmission is the medium that transmits power generated by the engine to the wheels via a mechanical system of gears</p>

    <h4>Scene 3: Vehicle Class</h4>
    <p>Types of vehicle class such as SUV, minivan, and wagon etc are measured</p>
